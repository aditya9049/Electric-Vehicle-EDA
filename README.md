EDA Objectives
The primary goals of the EDA include:

Understanding the Distribution of Electric Vehicles:
Distribution of vehicles by state, county, and city.
Trends in model years for electric vehicle adoption.
Distribution of electric vehicle types (Plug-in Hybrid, Battery Electric, etc.).
Electric Range Analysis:
Summary statistics of electric range across different vehicle types and manufacturers.
Comparison of electric ranges for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility.
Geospatial Analysis:
Mapping vehicle locations using latitude and longitude.
Correlation of electric vehicle adoption with census tracts and legislative districts.
Missing Data Treatment:
Handle missing values, especially for fields like Base MSRP and Electric Utility.
Preprocessing Steps
Missing Data Handling: Fill or drop missing values for critical columns like Base MSRP, Electric Utility, and Legislative District.
Categorical Encoding: Convert categorical variables (e.g., State, Make, Electric Vehicle Type) to numeric values for analysis if needed.
Geospatial Conversion: Parse the Vehicle Location column into latitude and longitude for visualization.
Analysis Insights
Vehicle Distribution: Number of vehicles by city, county, and state.
Model and Make Analysis: Which brands are the most popular, and what are their typical electric ranges?
CAFV Eligibility: Explore which vehicles are eligible for CAFV and how electric range affects this eligibility.
Time Trends: Examine how electric vehicle adoption has changed over time, based on model year.
Price Analysis: Investigate whether the base MSRP affects electric range or CAFV eligibility (if available).
Visualization Plan
Bar plots of vehicle counts by State, Make, Model Year.
Histograms or box plots of Electric Range for different Electric Vehicle Type.
Geospatial heatmaps showing vehicle concentrations by city or county.
Pie chart of CAFV eligibility breakdown.
Tools Used
Pandas: For data manipulation and handling missing values.
Seaborn/Matplotlib: For visualizing distributions and trends in the data.
Geopandas/Folium: For geospatial analysis and mapping vehicle locations.
Scikit-learn: For any further clustering or predictive modeling.
Conclusion
The EDA provides insights into the adoption of electric vehicles across the U.S., patterns in electric range, and how CAFV eligibility is distributed. The data also gives a detailed look into geospatial patterns in electric vehicle adoption, which may aid policymakers in understanding regional trends.
